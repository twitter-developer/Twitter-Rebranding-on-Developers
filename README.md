# Understanding the Effects of Twitter/X's Rebranding on Developers

This project collects and analyzes data from three social media platforms: Twitter/X, Mastodon, and Bluesky. The accompanying CSV files provide a small anonymized sample of the dataset. The full anonymized dataset will be released upon the acceptance of the associated research paper.


For the manuscript, you need to fill in your own information, such as your token, username, and password. 


For Twitter.py, you must first collect the users whose data you want to retrieve. For Mastodon.py and Bluesky.py, you can edit the keyword parameter to collect posts containing the specified keyword and then collect posts from the users.
